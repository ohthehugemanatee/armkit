## Introduction

The **Armkit (Azure Cloud Development Kit)** is an open-source software development
framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through Azure ARM Templates.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define Azure resources imperatively using
the power of modern programming languages. Using the Armkit library of
infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate Azure best practices in your
infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

Armkit is available in the following languages:

* JavaScript, TypeScript ([Node.js â‰¥ 10.3.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/))

-------

## Getting Started

Developers use the [Armkit framework] in one of the supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components called [constructs], which are composed together into [stacks], forming an "Armkit app".

They then use the [Armkit CLI](#) to interact with their Armkit app. The CLI allows developers to synthesize artifacts such as Azure ARM Templates, deploy stacks to development Azure accounts and "diff"
against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change.

The [Armkit Construct Library](#) includes a module for each Azure service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of how to use Azure. The Armkit Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and glue-logic required when integrating various Azure services to achieve your goals on Azure.

## Packages

The CDK for Azure includes two packages:

* [@armkit/core](https://github.com/Yetics/armkit/tree/development/packages/%40armkit/core) - A library for defining Azure resources using programming constructs.
* [armkit-cli](https://github.com/Yetics/armkit/tree/development/packages/armkit-cli) - A CLI that allows users to run commands to initialize, import, and synthesize CDK for Azure applications.


## Examples

We generated some sample constructs in [examples](./examples/README.md). This   could look like this:

#### **`helloArmkit.ts`**

```ts 
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, ArmStack } from '@armkit/core';
import {
  ContainerGroups, ContainerGroupPropertiesOsTypeEnum, MicrosoftContainerInstanceContainerGroupsTypeEnum, MicrosoftContainerInstanceContainerGroupsApiVersionEnum
} from './.generated/ContainerInstance'

export class HelloArmkit extends ArmStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    new ContainerGroups(this, 'MyContainerGroup', {
      name: 'azurecdktest',
      location: 'westeurope',
      apiVersion: MicrosoftContainerInstanceContainerGroupsApiVersionEnum['2019_12_01'],
      type: MicrosoftContainerInstanceContainerGroupsTypeEnum.MICROSOFT_CONTAINER_INSTANCE_CONTAINER_GROUPS,
      properties: {
        containers: [{
          name: 'ubuntu-server',
          properties: {
            image: 'ubuntu:18.04',
            command: ['sleep infinity'],
            resources: {
              requests: {
                cpu: 1,
                memoryInGB: 2
              },
              limits: {
                cpu: 1,
                memoryInGB: 2
              }
            }

          }
        }],
        osType: ContainerGroupPropertiesOsTypeEnum.LINUX,
      }
    })
  }
}

const app = new App({ outdir: 'cdk.out' });
new HelloArmkit(app, 'hello-armkit');
app.synth();
```
